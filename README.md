## Data Files

All site data lives in `/data` as JSON files. This is the first-version approach — future versions may migrate to a database or CMS.

### `data/sources.json`

All monitored official sources. Each source has:
- `id` — stable identifier referenced by other records
- `name` — human-readable name
- `url` — direct link to the source
- `type` — one of: `official_webpage`, `official_document_center`, `state_data`, etc.
- `trustTier` — one of: `primary_official`, `secondary_official`, `unofficial`, `community_submitted`
- `monitoringMethod` — how the source is monitored: `html_change_detection`, `document_link_detection`, or `null`
- `note` — any important caveats (e.g., "election-night results are unofficial until certified")

### `data/civic-roster.json`

Village Board members. Each record has:
- `office`, `name`, `status`, `termNote`, `electedYear`
- `sourceId` — references a source in `sources.json`
- `lastVerified` — date the record was last verified against its source
- `email` — official email only (no personal contact info)

**Policy:** Residential addresses are never stored, even if publicly listed.

### `data/timeline.json`

Historical events, sorted by year. Each event has:
- `year`, `event`, `detail`, `category`
- `sourceId` — may be `null` if no primary source is yet documented (flagged for review)

### `data/documents.json`

Public records indexed from the Village Legal Notices page. Each record has:
- `title`, `type` (resolution, ordinance, notice, report, plan)
- `status` — one of: `adopted`, `pending`, `superseded`, `needs_review`, etc.
- `sourceId`, `reviewStatus` — `reviewed`, `pending_review`, or `auto_detected`
- `category` — editorial grouping (e.g., "Land Use & Zoning", "Planning & Recreation")

### `data/editorial-standards.json`

The editorial principles that govern this site, displayed on the About page.

## Source Policy

### Trust Tiers

| Tier | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `primary_official` | Official government websites, certified documents, statutory public records |
| `secondary_official` | Official-adjacent sources — press releases, aggregated government data |
| `unofficial` | Community-submitted or unverified third-party information |
| `community_submitted` | User-contributed content pending source verification |

### Status Labels

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `current_official` | Active, verified from primary source |
| `official_document` | Published in official document center |
| `adopted` | Formally approved by governing body |
| `pending` | Under consideration or awaiting vote |
| `unofficial` | Not from a primary official source |
| `superseded` | Replaced by a newer document or record |
| `needs_review` | Flagged for human review before use |

## Automation Plan (Future)

The `/scripts` directory contains placeholder scripts for future source monitoring automation. None are currently active.

### Planned monitoring pipeline

1. **`check-source-changes.ts`** — master runner, dispatches per-source monitors nightly
2. **`fetch-legal-notices.ts`** — detects new documents on the Legal Notices page
3. **`fetch-boards-and-commissions.ts`** — detects roster changes on the Boards page
4. **`fetch-staff-directory.ts`** — detects staff directory changes

### Key rules for automation

- **Never auto-publish.** All detected changes are written to a `.cache/` review queue.
- **Human review is required** before any change appears in `/data` or on the public site.
- **Privacy first.** Scripts must not collect or store residential addresses or personal phone numbers.
- **Election results are never certified on election night.** The monitoring pipeline must not treat unofficial results as final.

### Suggested implementation approach

1. Run scripts via Vercel Cron Jobs or GitHub Actions on a nightly schedule
2. On change detection: write pending records to `.cache/`
3. Use a GitHub issue, webhook, or email notification for the review step
4. After human review and approval, manually update the relevant `/data` JSON file
5. The Next.js site rebuilds automatically on the next Vercel deploy

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Type check
npm run typecheck

# Build for production
npm run build
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the site.

## Deployment (Vercel)

1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect to Vercel — it will auto-detect Next.js
3. No environment variables required for the base version
4. Deploy: Vercel builds with `npm run build` and serves the output

The site uses Next.js App Router with server components for data rendering. JSON files are imported directly and statically rendered at build time.

## Editorial Principles

1. We prioritize official and primary sources.
2. We separate facts from context.
3. We label uncertainty.
4. We use AI carefully — review is required before publication.
5. We welcome corrections with sources.
6. We respect Greenville residents — no residential addresses.
7. We are independent and not affiliated with the official Village government.
